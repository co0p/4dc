# Goal

Generate a clear, dated improvement document for the project rooted at `path` that:

- Reflects the current health of the codebase with recent increments in place.
- Captures **lessons and emerging patterns** (good and bad).
- Surfaces **architectural and refactoring opportunities**.
- Produces a **list of concrete improvement proposals** that can later be turned into increments, but does not implement them.
- Keeps the project’s **architecture documentation** (for example, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) in sync with the actual system, including Mermaid-based C4 level 2 (containers) and level 3 (components) diagrams where required by the constitution.

The output should help the team and other 4dc prompts decide **what to improve next** and why.
