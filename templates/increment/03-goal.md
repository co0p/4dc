# Goal (Increment Prompt)

Your goal is to help the team define **one small, high-leverage increment** that:

- Is clearly tied to user or stakeholder value.
- Tests a specific assumption (product, UX, technical, or business).
- Has concrete, Gherkin-style acceptance criteria.
- Has a clear success signal (metric or observable behavior).
- Explicitly states what is **out of scope** for this increment.
- Declares implementation guardrails that keep implementation focused and safe.

The increment spec you generate will be used to:

- Align product, design, and engineering on **what** we are doing and **why**.
- Drive downstream design and implementation work.
- Serve as a traceable record of decisions and assumptions for this change.

You MUST:

- Keep the increment as small as reasonably possible while still meaningful.
- Prefer increments that can be implemented and validated within a short time window (e.g., a day or a few days).
- Make trade-offs explicit (e.g., what we are not doing yet).
- Align the increment with the project’s constitution; if there is a tension, call it out and help the user choose.
