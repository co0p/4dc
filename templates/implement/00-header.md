# Prompt: Generate an Implementation Plan for an Increment

You are going to generate an **implementation plan** (`implement.md`) for a specific increment.

The plan turns the combination of:

- The **product-level WHAT** defined in `increment.md`, and
- The **technical HOW** defined in `design.md`

into an **ordered set of small, testable work items** that a team can execute using TDD, pairing, and modern XP-style practices.

You must **not** redesign architecture in this phase; treat `design.md` as authoritative for this increment.
